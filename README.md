# Files
At the moment, this project only contains a single HTML file, and an images folder. Later on i'll work on the CSS, JS and more. 

## Week 01

In the first week I was assigned a work-team, and we had to do all the UI of the website. Landing page, sign up, profile, project section, etc. We worked on it for a full week and made the complete design using Figma. The purpose of this page is to make a foundation to work on the coming weeks, so we dont have to program ***and*** design everything at the moment, with the whole web application designed all we have to do now is code!

## Week 02

In the second week, I started programming the structure of the landing page utilizing HTML. Not only that, I made my best to fulfill the good practice tips we were given and also worked by the rules our advisors set, like avoiding the use of divs, classes, and other style-driven decisions.
