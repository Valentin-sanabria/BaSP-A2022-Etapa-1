In the first week I was assigned a work-team, and we had to do all the UI of the website. Landing page, sign up, profile, project section, etc. We worked on it for a full week and made the complete design using Figma.

In the fourth week, we kept working on the styling of the web page. We have to create a specific .CSS file for each component of the landing page (for ex. nav, footer, main, etc). Luckily, we are able to use Flexbox this week as well as incentivized to use justify-content and align-items. We also need to make the web responsive, by utilizing not only Flexbox but also media-queries, which are extremely useful for hiding and showing HTML elements.
